							<h2>Our story</h2>
							<p>Dasha and Jake met in Ames, Iowa in 2017 through mutual friends at Iowa State University. They fell deeply in love very quickly.
								Dasha was infatuated with Jake’s long blond hair and expertise with cooking on the grill, and Jake was greatly impressed by Dasha’s
								independence and fearlessness to try new things. They traveled throughout the Midwest together and beyond, taking every opportunity
								for a short adventure to a new place. And, when it came time to graduate and leave Ames, they endeavored to stay together throughout
								the next step of their journey. Dasha applied, and was accepted, to the PhD program at the University of Iowa, and, as fate would have
								it, Jake was accepted into the law program the following year at the same university.</p>

								<h2></h2>
									The couple traveled home to Ukraine in the summer of 2018 and took a long vacation with Dasha’s parents, Nick and Inna. They visited
									family and friends, spent warm evenings at a resort by the Black Sea, tasted wine, explored medieval castles, and took a scenic flight
									on a hot air balloon. The following summer, Nick and Inna made the trip to Iowa and got to see all that the Midwest has to offer! They
									traveled to South Dakota and the Black Hills, attended the Sturgis motorcycle rally (a favorite of Nick’s!), camped under the shadow of
									Mount Rushmore, rode horses through the hills, hiked through the Badlands and then drove across Iowa to spend their last few days in Chicago,
									exploring the city and admiring the impressive architecture.</p>

								<p>Jake and Dasha have been on countless adventures together from Los Angeles, California and Golden, Colorado, to St. Louis, Missouri and
								St. Petersburg, Florida, from Barcelona, Spain, to Kramatorsk, Ukraine. Now, they are preparing for their next adventure in Christchurch,
								New Zealand, where Dasha has accepted a lecturer position at the University of Canterbury! Jake has just graduated from law school and will
								transfer his law license to New Zealand, and Dasha is putting the finishing touches on her PhD dissertation before graduating in December.
								They will be making the big move in January of 2024. They are excited for this new adventure and hopeful for many more adventures in the future!</p>

							<h2>We’re Eloping!</h2>
							<p>Although many of you have expressed your excitement about joining us in New Zealand for our wedding, we have decided to elope!
								 We are extremely grateful that many of you would be willing to undertake the hassle and expense of traveling so far to witness
								 our wedding. However, many of our friends and family simply will not be able to make it, including our loved ones in Ukraine.
								 The engagement party in Des Moines will be our opportunity to celebrate the engagement and wedding with you before we leave!
								 And, of course, if you are firm in your desire to visit us in New Zealand, despite not being able to attend the wedding, we would
								 love for you to pay us a visit after we get settled.
								 <br></p>
								 <p>If you're curious about the elopement in New Zealand, <a href="https://weddingsnewzealand.com/">here</a> is a sample of what we're
								 imagining our wedding to look like next year. </p>
